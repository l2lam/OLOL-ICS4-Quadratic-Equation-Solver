# **BIG TRIGS**

This game is for students in **grade 9** who want to learn **grade 10 math**. In this game, there will be questions relating to **trigonometry**, and the **"SOHCAHTOA"** formulas. These questions are not hard questions, just introductory questions meant to help students branch into grade 10 math more easily. This game is called **"Big Trigs"**. This game is used for testing to see if it is solvable for a 9 grade student entering into grade 10, meaning they just finished mathematics in grade 9. The game is designed so that it has the specific amount of difficulty while not being impossible with the given questions. It is made to be easy for an entry level into grade 10 mathematics. However, it is not going to be extremly difficult to do as this is only for beginners in grade 10. the questions in the game are going to be randomized, and there will be a time limit when you press the **start** button.
