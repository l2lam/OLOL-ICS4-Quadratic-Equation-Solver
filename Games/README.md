# Games Assignment Instructions
This is for elementary students entering grade 9 to help them learn the various formulas for geometry. They are simple questions but the numbers used get bigger as they go.

One problem we found was the generator added decimals so we had to make every answer have a .0 at the end. There's also a chance that the circle questions have many more decimal points. If we were to do this again we would fix both issues. 

In the future we could add more questions such as area and perimeter of more difficult shapes. We could also turn the ‘if’ and ‘else’ statements into variables to make it easier on ourselves, or to shorten the code.
